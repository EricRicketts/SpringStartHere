In this project and many to follow we are using a separate configuration class to add beans to the Spring Context.
A Bean is nothing more than an object which is placed into the Spring Context.

In this project we define the classes which produce the objects in the package main.
In this project we define the beans in the ProjectConfig class which is in the config package.

The steps to add a Bean to the Spring Context via a configuration class are:

1.  Define a configuration class (ProjectConfig) in the config package.  Add a @Configuration annotation to the class.
2.  Add a method to the configuration class which returns the object instance you want to add to the context.  You will
add the @Bean annotation to this method.
3.  In the entry point to the application, initialize a context using the configuration class as an argument.  One then
can use the context method "getBean" to retrieve the desired bean from the context.

It is important to understand in this way of adding Beans to the Spring Context what is actually happening is that
when Spring initializes its context, it calls the methods defined in the configuration class so that the beans are
added to the context during context initialization.
